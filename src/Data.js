  AboutTextParagraph1:
    "Born in 1953, South Korean artist SoonHee Lee, also known as SooNee, began her artistic journey in 2006. Without formal fine arts training, she forged a distinctive path through passion and relentless dedication. Lee's early works featured oil and acrylic on canvas, but she later embraced coffee and traditional Korean ink on Hanji (mulberry paper). This transition allowed her to merge modern sensibilities with Korean heritage, making her work both deeply personal and universally resonant. Her ethereal, introspective figures often appear lost in thought, suspended between reality and dream. Over the years, her work evolved from delicate floral dreamscapes, such as her Dream Series, known for intricate rose patterns, to the evocative Her Series, where minimalism and quiet emotion take center stage. She masterfully balances space and texture to evoke solitude, contemplation, and depth.",
  AboutTextParagraph2:
    " Lee has held 29 solo exhibitions and participated in over 200 group shows worldwide. Her accolades include the AIAM Public Choice Award (2019, France) and Best Artist Award (2022, Brussels). Most recently, she exhibited at the 2025 Grand Palais Indépendants in France, further cementing her presence on the global stage. A defining moment in her career came when a coffee spill on Hanji revealed the medium’s organic warmth, inspiring her signature style. Through her work, she invites viewers into a world of quiet introspection, where emotions and time unfold subtly on the canvas.",
